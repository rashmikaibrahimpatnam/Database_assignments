 2 <TITLE>DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION</TITLE> <AUTHOR> By Claire Miller Reuters</AUTHOR> <DATELINE> NEW YORK March 24 </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar s losses today but senior dealers here believe the U S currency is headed for a further retreat Although the intervention was widespread dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies Moreover hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline dealers said The market can be bigger than the central banks And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore said a dealer at one major U S bank As the dollar dropped to post World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U S currency Reports of the authorities actions helped the dollar recover to about 149 45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post war low of 148 20 yen in the Far East But it still failed to regain Monday s U S closing level of 150 00/05 yen Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1 5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U S via the Federal Reserve Meanwhile there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148 50 yen today Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen The Fed s last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1 87 marks The authorities actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U S Japan West Germany Britain France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market For one thing some dealers believed that the Fed s purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the U S central bank s own account suggesting a rather watered down American commitment to the currency accord The Bank of England s action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank reinforcing the market s view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact No one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp I m not convinced the intervention was concerted said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago It s a yen problem more than anything else Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the U S limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen The dollar s break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury s hands behind its back The U S cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized Despite official denials some traders still feel the U S would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation s trade deficit The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan Indeed U S Treasury secretary James Baker s comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the U S currency and kicked off the latest retreat The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services The currency market is becoming very political said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future dealers said Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year it won t be enough to help the trade situation much said Bourdain of BankAmerica who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days Reuter 3 </BODY>,832,1,0.001201923076923077

 2 <TITLE>BRITISH BANKS RESIST SIGNING MEXICO PACKAGE</TITLE> <AUTHOR> By Marguerite Nugent Reuters</AUTHOR> <DATELINE> LONDON March 26 </DATELINE><BODY>British banks are resisting signing a 76 billion dlr rescheduling package for Mexico in a last ditch effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new 7 7 billion dlr loan contained in the package Christopher Brougham regional manager rescheduling unit at Lloyds Bank Plc said in response to a Reuter enquiry that the six major U K Clearing banks last week sent a telex to Citibank saying they would contribute what was requested provided all other major lenders did the same and that the U S Banks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required by them Other bankers who declined to be identified said other groups of banks particularly those in Switzerland France and Canada were equally reluctant to sign although they had not sent any telex to Citibank which chairs Mexico s 13 bank advisory group However they said it was likely that if and when the British banks sign the accord the others are likely to follow Under the agreement for which the signing began on Friday commercial banks are being asked to contribute 12 9 pct of their exposure to Mexico as of August 1982 That was the date of the first Mexican debt crisis After months of haggling a proposed rescheduling agreement for Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington Ever since then the advisory group of which Lloyds is a member has been attempting to round up the needed signatories However there has been considerable resistance to the package partly because of some of the clauses it contains and partly because many small U S Regional banks do not want to increase their exposure to any Latin American countries Brougham said We British banks have always played along for Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six clearers jointly but each sent its own telex In addition to Lloyds telexes were sent by National Westminster Bank Plc Barclays Bank Plc Midland Bank Plc 127 tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc Brougham noted that so far the U S Banks have only reached 83 1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them while the level of contributions from the U K Banks is well in excess of 90 pct The U S Figure should be closer to ours he said Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the regional U S Banks noting that even if they don t contribute to the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the existing loans The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and bankers are hoping all will go according to plan In the meantime bankers expect further pressure will be exercised on the regional banks and the major U S Banks to find a solution to the problem Many have suggested that the larger U S Banks should take on the additional obligations but so far they have resisted this Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U S Banks will come from U S Regulators notably the Federal Reserve Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British banks and other national groups as a matter of principal and burden sharing rather than as a pressure tactic to force the U S Banks to make up their share The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the protracted negotiations surrounding the agreement The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays At the signing in New York last Friday Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will continue to be open and willing to share with them the business opportunities which its future growth will create Petricioli said Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico is one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their exposure But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in February in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package On Friday Petricioli said We will be a lot more expeditious in processing the requests of banks that have supported us The pressure on the U S Banks comes at a time when other major Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt negotiations Brazil the third world s largest debtor has suspended all interest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt Many of the major U S Banks including Citibank have already said they might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and take the financial losses which could total billions of dollars This would be required by U S Banking regulations if the interest payments are more than 90 days overdue However the U S Banks are not the only ones threatened by regulations In the U K A proposed Inland Revenue ruling would affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans many of which are made to Latin American countries Basically the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank can claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan interest payments The British banks are planning to fight the proposals as their implementation could prove extremely costly not just in terms of compliance but in limiting future business REUTER 3 </BODY>,927,1,0.0010787486515641855
